This is a Predictive Maintenance example that trains a deep learning autoencoder on normal operating data of an industrial machine. The example walks through exctracting relevant features from the raw data, setting up and training an LSTM-based autoencoder to detect abnormal behavior, and evaluating the results on a validation set.

This demo is implemented as a MATLAB project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need. 

## Setup 
To Run:
1. Open the MATLAB Project `AnomalyDetection.prj`
2. Run Part 1 - Data Preparation & Feature Extraction
3. Run Part 2 - Modeling
