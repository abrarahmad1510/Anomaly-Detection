This is a Predictive Maintenance example that trains a deep learning autoencoder on normal operating data of an industrial machine. The example walks through exctracting relevant features from the raw data, setting up and training an LSTM-based autoencoder to detect abnormal behavior, and evaluating the results on a validation set.
This demo is implemented as a MATLAB project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need.
