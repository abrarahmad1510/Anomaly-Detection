# Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders Demo
This demo shows a Predictive Maintenance example of training a deep learning autoencoder on normal operating condition data of an industrial machine. We show how to prepare, and model a LSTM-based autoencoder algorithm to detect abnormal behavior.

This demo is implemented as a MATLAB project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need.
